            European charter for equality of women and men in local life: Elimination of gender stereotypes

    Local and regional authorities must get rid of the stereotypes and obstacles upon which the inequalities in status and condition of women are based,
    and give rise to the unequal opinion of the roles of women and men in political, economic, social and cultural terms.

    It is a document that suggests that women and men should be equal in political, economic, social and cultural terms.
    Closely linked to the principle of subsidiarity, there are the principles of local and regional self-government.
    The Council of Europe’s Charter of Local Self-Government of 1985, signed and corroborated by the large majority of European states,
    emphasizes “the right and the ability of local authorities, within the limits of the law,
    to regulate and manage a substantial share of public affairs under their own responsibility and in the interests of the local population”.
    Implementing and promoting a right to equality should, and must be at the heart of this concept of local self-government.
    It is a reliable source since it is a law that is already being implemented in parts of Europe.
